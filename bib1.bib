	abstract = {Catalytic chemical processes such as hydrocracking, gasification and pyrolysis play a vital role in the renewable energy and net zero transition. Due to the complex and non-linear behaviours during operation, catalytic chemical processes require a powerful modelling tool for prediction and optimisation for smart operation, speedy green process routes discovery and rapid process design. However, challenges remain due to the lack of an effective modelling and optimisation toolbox, which requires not only a precise analysis but also a fast optimisation. Here, we propose a hybrid machine learning strategy by embedding the physics-based continuum lumping kinetic model into the data-driven artificial neural network framework. This hybrid model is adopted as the surrogate model in the multi-objective optimisation and demonstrated in the benchmarking of a hydrocracking process. The results show that the novel hybrid surrogate model exhibits the mean square error less than 0.01 by comparing with the physics-based simulation results. This well-trained hybrid model was then integrated with non-dominated-sort genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) as the surrogate model to evaluate and optimise the yield and selectivity of the hydrocracking process. The Pareto front from the multi-objective optimisation was able to identify the trade-off curve between the objective functions which is essential for the decision-making during process design. Our work indicates that adopting the hybrid machine learning strategy as the surrogate model in the multi-objective optimisation is a promising approach in various complex catalytic chemical processes to enable an accurate computation as well as a rapid optimisation.},

@article{Peng2022,
	abstract = {By means of advanced techniques of molecular simulations, we have studied the chemical equilibrium of methane steam reforming reaction. We have computed the conversion of CH4, yield and selectivity of H2, etc. in the gas phase by reactive canonical Monte Carlo (RCMC) method and compared with those from Gibbs energy of formation method. The consistency of the two methods encourages us to use the RCMC method to optimize the operating conditions. We found that under low pressure 0.1 MPa, high temperature 1073 K and high water-gas ratio H2O/CH4 = 5, the CH4 conversion, H2 yield and selectivity were the highest, with the values of 99.93%, 3.51 mol/molCH4 and 99.98%, respectively. In addition, the pore size of activated carbon significantly affects the chemical equilibrium composition in the pores. Since low pressure and high temperature are not conducive to the adsorption of reactive components by activated carbon, the chemical balance in the pores cannot be improved. At 773 K, 3.0 MPa and pore width is less than 2 nm, the pores are mainly occupied by CH4 and H2O reactant molecules. Further increasing the temperature can increase the H2 content in the pores, but the adsorption capacity in the pores will decrease. We use activated carbon to adsorb and separate CO and H2 (CO:H2 = 1:3), the main components after the gas phase reaction reaches equilibrium. At 298 K, 7.5 MPa and the optimal pore width of 0.76 nm, the CO/H2 selectivity is 28.3 and the CO adsorption capacity is 8.45 mmol/cm3.},

	abstract = {Steam methane (CH4--H2O) reforming in the presence of a catalyst, usually nickel, is the most common technology for generating synthesis gas as a feedstock in chemical synthesis and a source of pure H2 and CO. What is essential from the perspective of further gas use is the parameter describing a ratio of equilibrium concentration of hydrogen to carbon monoxide (H/C=xH2/xCO). The parameter is determined by operating temperature and the initial ratio of steam concentration to methane SC=xH2O0/xCH40. In this paper, the author presents a thermodynamic analysis of the effect of green hydrogen addition to a fuel mixture on the steam methane reforming process of gaseous phase (CH4/H2)--H2O. The thermodynamic analysis of conversion of hydrogen-enriched methane (CH4/H2)--H2O has been performed using parametric equation formalism, allowing for determining the equilibrium composition of the process in progress. A thermodynamic condition of carbon precipitation in methane reforming (CH4/H2) with the gaseous phase of H2O has been interpreted. The ranges of substrate concentrations creating carbon deposition for temperature T = 1000 K have been determined, based on the technologies used. The results obtained can serve as a model basis for describing the properties of steam reforming of methane and hydrogen mixture (CH4/H2)--H2O.},

	abstract = {Catalytic dry reforming of mixed waste plastics, from a range of different municipal, commercial and industrial sources, were processed in a two-stage fixed bed reactor. Pyrolysis of the plastics took place in the first stage and dry (CO2) reforming of the evolved pyrolysis gases took place in the second stage in the presence of Ni/Al2O3 and Ni-Co/Al2O3 catalysts in order to improve the production of syngas from the dry reforming process. The results showed that the highest amount of syngas yield was obtained from the dry reforming of plastic waste from the agricultural industry with the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, producing 153.67mmolsyngasgâˆ’1waste. The addition of cobalt metal as a promoter to the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst did not have a major influence on syngas yield. Overall, the catalytic-dry reforming of waste plastics from various waste treatment plants showed great potential towards the production of synthesis gases.},

	abstract = {Steel slag-derived CaO (CaO(SS)) was applied in cyclic sorption enhanced steam reforming of coke oven gas process (cyclic SE-SRCOG) for high-purity hydrogen production. Effects of leaching acid concentration on the cyclic CO2 capture capacity of CaO(SS) were investigated. Using 1 mol/L acetic acid solution as leaching solution, the prepared CaO-based sorbent showed a stable CO2 capture capacity of 0.27 gCO2/gCaO after 35 sorption-desorption cycles. Impacts of operating modes (with different particles contents and loading patterns), operating procedure, and leaching residue (LR) blending on cyclic SE-SRCOG performance were experimentally investigated in detail. Combined catalyst-sorbent by adhesively tableting exhibited the worst stability due to loss of Ni active sites, caused by severe sintering and coverage by CaCO3. With a reforming temperature of 600 $\,^{\circ}$C, cyclic SE-SRCOG with layered packing catalyst-sorbent particles could achieve H2 purity of 95% and CH4 conversion of 87% at the 5th cycle, and they were still maintained to be 87% and 65% at the 10th cycle, respectively. In operating mode using layered packed catalyst-sorbent particles, integration of LR into the sorbent facilitated further improvements of CH4 conversion to 86% at the 10th cycle, mainly due to that LR could act as catalytic promoters of SRCOG and sintering-resistance spacers of CaO(SS).},

@article{Xu2020,
	abstract = {The use of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is a promising approach towards achieving sustainable electricity production from fuel. The utilisation of the hydrocarbons and biomass in SOFCs is particularly attractive owing to their wide distribution, high energy density, and low price. The long-term operation of SOFCs using such fuels remains difficult owing to a lack of an effective diagnosis and optimisation system, which requires not only a precise analysis but also a fast response. In this study, we developed a hybrid model for an on-line analysis of SOFCs at the cell level. The model combines a multi-physics simulation (MPS) and deep learning, overcoming the complexity of MPS for a model-based control system, and reducing the cost of building a database (compared with the experiments) for the training of a deep neural network. The maximum temperature gradient and heat generation are two target parameters for an efficient operation of SOFCs. The results show that a precise prediction can be achieved from a trained AI algorithm, in which the relative error between the MPS and AI models is less than 1%. Moreover, an online optimisation is realised using a genetic algorithm, achieving the maximum power density within the limitations of the temperature gradient and operating conditions. This method can also be applied to the prediction and optimisation of other non-liner, dynamic systems.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide-abated hydrogen can be synthesised via various processes, one of which is sorption enhanced steam methane reforming (SE-SMR), which produces separated streams of high purity H2 and CO2. Properties of hydrogen and the sorbent material hinder the ability to rapidly upscale SE-SMR, therefore the use of artificial intelligence models is useful in order to assist scale up. Advantages of a data driven soft-sensor model over thermodynamic simulations, is the ability to obtain real time information dependent on actual process conditions. In this study, two soft sensor models have been developed and used to predict and estimate variables that would otherwise be difficult direct measured. Both artificial neural networks and the random forest models were developed as soft sensor prediction models. They were shown to provide good predictions for gas concentrations in the reformer and regenerator reactors of the SE-SMR process using temperature, pressure, steam to carbon ratio and sorbent to carbon ratio as input process features. Both models were very accurate with high R2 values, all above 98%. However, the random forest model was more precise in the predictions, with consistently higher R2 values and lower mean absolute error (0.002-0.014) compared to the neural network model (0.005-0.024).},

	abstract = {Methane (CH4) is the major component of currently abundant natural gas and a prominent green-house gas. Steam reforming of methane (SRM) is an important technology for the conversion of CH4 into H2 and syngas. To improve the catalytic activity and coking resistance of SRM catalysts, great efforts (including the addition of promoters, development of advanced supports, and structural modification, etc.) have been made with considerable progress in the past decade. Meanwhile, a series of novel processes have been explored for more efficient and energy-saving SRM. In this scenario, a comprehensive review on the recent advances in SRM is necessary to provide a constructive insight into the development of SRM technology, however, is still lacking. Herein, the improvements in catalyst construction for conventional SRM and the newly developed SRM processes in the past decade are presented and analyzed. First, the critical issues of SRM catalysts are briefly introduced. Then, the recent research advances of the most popular Ni based catalysts and the catalysts based on the other non-noble metals (Co, Cu, Mo etc.) and the efficient but costly noble metals (Au, Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru etc.) are discussed. Furthermore, the development of the representative modified SRM processes, including thermo-photo hybrid SRM, sorbent enhanced SRM, oxidative SRM, chemical looping SRM, plasma and electrical-field enhanced SRM, is demonstrated, and their advantages and limits are compared. Finally, a critical perspective is provided to enlighten future work on this significant area.},

Therefore, in this short review, we focus on hydrogen production through reforming processes especially steam and dry reforming and the nickel catalysts' performance for hydrogen production. Particularly focusing on effective parameters including mesoporous supports (SBA-15, MCM-41, KIT, and SBA-16) and promoters. Since the trapping of active metals into the MCM-41 mesostructure with smaller pores makes them appreciated for catalytic applications, therefore we highlight the recent literature achievements on DRM by promoted/unpromoted Ni catalysts over MCM-41 support for hydrogen production. In this review, attention will be given to different catalyst particles size and the effect of metal dispersion on mesoporous silica supports for enhancing catalytic activities in a comprehensive and comparative manner.},

Single syngas treatment through primary and secondary tar removal method is insufficient to produce a tar free syngas. Currently widely applied tar removal methods are catalytic reforming and plasma reforming. Though both methods have hindrances of fast catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and reduced syngas selectivity with large quantities of undesired liquid products from plasma reforming. Our review paper showed that hybrid plasma catalysis could be a breakthrough in tar reforming methods and overcome major drawbacks. Though, very little work on review articles have reported merging non-thermal plasma and heterogeneous catalyst. Plasma catalysis offers an inexpensive viable future technology of tar reforming through biomass gasification. The article assessed in-depth the synergistic effect created during the interaction of energetic plasma species and catalyst radicals in tar reforming.

	abstract = {The Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) anode materials are catalytically active for Direct Internal Reforming (DIR) thus avoiding the need of external reformer. However, practical application of DIR in SOFCs requires careful system design and selection of operating conditions to avoid cell degradation due to carbon depositions and other impurities. In recent years, numerous simulation studies, besides experimental investigations, have been carried out to understand the physical and electrochemical complexities of DIR-based SOFC systems in order to develop viable designs and optimize the operating conditions before conducting costly experiments. The objective of this work is to review the present status of DIR-SOFC modeling efforts and consolidate their findings in order to highlight the unresolved problems for future research in this field. A specific focus of this review has been given to the multiscale mathematical modeling. Pre-reforming techniques, influences of the chemical and electrochemical reaction kinetics and operational variables along with future prospects of the DIR-SOFC have been also reviewed and discussed.},

@article{Cherif2022,
	abstract = {This study focuses on the design and optimization of autothermal reforming reactor for hydrogen production. Aiming for higher hydrogen yield, improving the thermal coupling efficiency and mitigating the hot and cold spots, a novel design was conducted and optimized. The configuration improved the performance compared to the traditional model: the highest average temperature was reduced by 24.8%, while the methane conversion improved by 27.2%. The released heat, which can be recovered for further utilization, was significantly increased as the outlet temperature was around 34.5% higher in the novel design compared to the conventional ATR indicating higher thermal efficiency. To further improve this design, a multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization approach was employed to find the optimum catalyst arrangement providing the maximum hydrogen yield with the lowest local wall temperature. Through the optimization, a slight enhancement in hydrogen yield was achieved compared to the design case; however, significant improvement was attained for the thermal behavior compared to the traditional reactor: a decrease in the maximum local wall temperature of 39.3%, the disappearance of the hot spot on the wall and increase in the average outlet temperature of 33.4%. This latter result proves improved heat exploitation in the proposed ATR design.},

In specific, techno-economic and sensitivity analysis of the existing hydrogen production platforms and processes is need for an hour to boost the future hydrogen economical aspects. This will have greater impact on future hydrogen production project designs and developing new approaches to reduce the overall production costs to make it as cheaper fuel. The sensitivity analysis of various hydrogen production process such as pyrolysis, gasification, steam reforming of natural gas, dark fermentation, photobiolysis, water electrolysis and renewable liquid reforming were reviewed to evaluate their merits and demerits along with cost-effectiveness. On economic view point, steam reforming of natural gas is efficient, low cost and best methods for hydrogen production. A future research is required to reduce energy input and trapping carbon dioxide emission using membrane models.},

	abstract = {Wall-coated nickel-based methane steam reformers are extensively used in hydrogen production. In such devices, nickel-based catalyst is coated on the walls and heat is supplied for the reforming process. Due to the existence of endothermic and exothermic characteristics, big temperature differences appear in the reformers, which is likely to cause serious mechanical degradation of the catalyst. This study conducts a topology optimization of the catalyst distribution to reduce the maximum temperature differences of the reformers. Nine cases with different inlet gas compositions and heating fluxes are optimized. For comparison, methane conversion rates are constrained to have the same values as the corresponding reference cases. Results show that optimized catalysts discretely distribute on the wall with different lengths. The narrow catalysts distribute upstream, while the wide catalysts distribute downstream. The optimized results not only largely reduce the maximum temperature differences (24%--82%) and improve temperature uniformity (40%--85%), but also maintain high methane conversion rates. The proposed approach could help to design the catalyst distribution of reformers.},

@article{Silva2015,
	abstract = {The steam reforming of the main biodiesel by-product, glycerol, has been catching up the interest of the scientific community in the last years. The use of glycerol for hydrogen production is an advantageous option not only because glycerol is renewable but also because its use would lead to the decrease of the price of biodiesel, thus making it more competitive. Consequently, the use of biodiesel at large scale would significantly reduce CO2 emissions comparatively to fossil fuels. Moreover, hydrogen itself is seen as a very attractive clean fuel for transportation purposes. Therefore, the industrialization of the glycerol steam reforming (GSR) process would have a tremendous global environmental impact. In the last years, intensive research regarding GSR thermodynamics, catalysts, reaction mechanisms and kinetics, and innovative reactor configurations (sorption enhanced reactors (SERs) and membrane reactors (MRs)) has been done, aiming for improving the process effectiveness. In this review, the main challenges and strategies adopted for optimization of GSR process are addressed, namely the GSR thermodynamic aspects, the last developments on catalysis and kinetics, as well as the last advances on GSR performed in SERs and MRs.},

@article{Sharma2019,
	abstract = {Small-scale steam methane reforming units produce more than 12% of all the CO2-equivalent emissions from hydrogen production and, unlike large-scale units, are usually not integrated with other processes. In this article, the authors examine the hitherto under-explored potential to utilise the excess heat available in the small-scale steam methane reforming process for partial carbon dioxide capture. Reforming temperature has been identified as a critical operating parameter to affect the amount of excess heat available in the steam methane reforming process. Calculations suggest that reforming the natural gas at 850 $\,^{\circ}$C, rather than 750 $\,^{\circ}$C, increases the amount of excess heat available by about 28.4% (at 180 $\,^{\circ}$C)while, sacrificing about 1.62% and 1.09% in the thermal and exergetic efficiency of the process, respectively. Preliminary calculations suggest that this heat could potentially be utilised for partial carbon capture from reformer flue gas, via structured adsorbents, in a compact capture unit. The reforming temperature can be adjusted in order to regulate the amount of excess heat, and thus the carbon capture rate.},

@article{Clarke1997,
	abstract = {Steam reforming of hydrocarbons such as natural gas is an attractive method of producing the hydrogen fuel gas required by fuel cells. It may be carried out external to the fuel cell or internally. The two types of fuel cell in which internal reforming is most appropriate are the molten carbonate (MCFC), operating at ca. 650$\,^{\circ}$C and the solid oxide (SOFC) which currently operates above 800$\,^{\circ}$C. At such temperatures, the heat liberated by the electrochemical reactions within the cell can be utilised by the endothermic steam reforming reaction. This paper reviews some of the catalytic aspects of internal reforming in these two types of cell. In the MCFC the major catalyst issue is that of long term activity in the presence of a corrosive alkaline environment produced by the cell's electrolyte. In Europe, this is being addressed by British Gas and others, in a programme part-funded by the European Commission. In this programme, potential catalysts for the direct internal reforming MCFC were evaluated in `out-of-cell' tests. This has led to the demonstration of a 1 kW proof-of-concept DIR-MCFC stack and the start of a European `Advanced DIR-MCFC' project. For the SOFC, it has been shown that state-of-the-art nickel cermet anodes can provide sufficient activity for steam reforming without the need for additional catalyst. However, anode degradation may occur when steam reforming is carried out for long periods. New anode materials could therefore offer significant benefits.},

@article{Stojic2003,
	abstract = {Hydrogen production via electrolysis of water from alkaline aqueous electrolytes is a well-established conventional technology. However, due to high energy requirements of about 4.5--5kWh/mn3 H2 in most industrial electrolysers, the cost of hydrogen produced in such a way is high. This is a limiting factor for the use of this method on a large scale, except in countries where the electricity is very cheap. There were various attempts to improve this process, like zero-gap cell geometry, development of new diaphragm materials, development of new electrocatalytic materials for electrodes, etc. We tried here to use ionic activators to reduce energy consumption. Two types of activators, both ethylenediamine complexes of cobalt, were used separately or in combination with some molybdates. The activation energies were significantly decreased in the presence of single ionic activators. However, the best results regarding the activation energy reduction were obtained when combinations with the molybdate were used. On the basis of the results of our experiments there is a strong indication that the activation with ionic activators reduces energy needs per mass unit of hydrogen produced for more than 10% in some cases, compared to those of non-activated electrolytes.},

	abstract = {The thermodynamics of butanol steam reformation for the production of hydrogen were simulated using a Gibbs free-energy-minimisation method with water--butanol molar feed ratios (WBFR) between 1 and 18, a pressure range of 1--50bar and reaction temperatures from 300 to 900$\,^{\circ}$C. The differences in H2 and CO production were calculated as functions of WBFR and temperature at 1bar. On the basis of the equilibrium calculations with higher-hydrocarbon compounds excluded, the optimal operating conditions obtained were 600--800$\,^{\circ}$C, 1bar and WBFR=9--12. At these conditions, the yield of hydrogen and carbon monoxide was maximised and methane selectivity minimised. The yield of hydrogen was in the range of 75.13--81.27% (wet basis) with selectivities of 46.20--54.96%. This was achieved at a temperature of 800$\,^{\circ}$C and WBFR from 9 to 12. Carbon monoxide yield ranged between 65.48 and 55.57% (wet basis), with selectivities ranging from 14.56 to 10.66%. The formation of coke was completely inhibited at these operating conditions. In order to evaluate the effect of methane on coke formation at lower temperatures, simulations were performed in two sets, i.e., primary products (H2, CO, CO2 and C) including or excluding methane. The results indicate that some coke can be hydrogenated to methane at 300$\,^{\circ}$C and WBFR=3, and that higher pressure favours hydrogenation reactions. Higher pressure had a negative effect on hydrogen and carbon monoxide yields.},

	abstract = {The catalytic steam reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons has been holding an interest in scientific societies for the past two decades. The hydrogen production from steam reforming of glycerol, ethanol and other oxygenates such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol are more suitable choice not just because it can be produced from renewable sources, but it also helps to decrease the transportation fuel price and making it more competitive. In addition, hydrogen itself is a green fuel for the transportation sector. The studies on the production of hydrogen from various reforming technologies revealed a remarkable impact on the environmental and socio-economic issues. Researchers became more focused on glycerol steam reforming (GSR), ethanol steam reforming (ESR) and other oxygenates to investigate the catalyst suitability, their kinetics and challenges for the sustainability of the oil and gas production. In the present work, the authors critically addressed the challenges and strategies for hydrogen production via GSR, ESR and other oxygenates reforming process. This review covers extensively thermodynamic parametric analysis, catalysts developments, kinetics and advancement in the operational process for glycerol, ethanol and few other oxygenates. This detailed investigation only highlights the steam reforming process (SRP) of these oxygenates at the laboratory experimental stage. It was found that from this review, there are many technical issues, which lead to economic challenges. The issues are yet to be addressed and thus, these particular applications require faster accelerations at the pilot scale, taking into the consideration of the current pandemic and economic issues, for a safer and greener environment.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen storage systems (HSSs), are the backbone of feasible hydrogen economy. To provide a reliable renewable energy system, safe, cost effective and compact HSS is due. Physical storage systems involve the compressed gas, liquid and cryo-compressed techniques while material based one involves adsorptive materials, metal hydrides and chemical storage materials. In this paper, the features of a variety of HSSs are impartially discussed. The technical comparative analysis of the different physical and material based types of HSSs illustrates the paradoxical inherent features, including gravimetric and volumetric storage densities and parameters associated with storage and release processes, among these systems. Accordingly, no ideal hydrogen storage technique can be considered the best-fit for all stationary and automotive applications. Therefore, not only a unique HSS solution can properly provide the needs, but a set of complementary HSS solutions which may offer the system designer several options. This set of options can be hardly interpretable in case of the unclear definition of the application needs which may be time variant. Inside this review, the critical insights and recommendations about suitable applications for storage systems are provided. Different standards and codes alongside the corresponding tests are demonstrated for the different storage technologies. Moreover, storage vessels research work is overviewed for the different hydrogen storage technologies. In addition, the failure behaviour, criteria and prediction models are investigated for composite vessels subjected to high pressures and extreme temperatures degrading their mechanical behaviour and failure resistance.},

In this original research, a comparative energetic study on LOHC and other hydrogen storage technologies was conducted using net energy analysis to quantitatively compare various hydrogen storage technologies. First, the basic RHFC system was modeled by a 0-dimensional simulation, and the system efficiency was analyzed. Then, a net energy analysis was conducted by evaluating energy stored on investment (ESOIe) values. The RHFC system with LOHC showed a higher ESOIe of 53 for weekly (<100 h) and 18 for monthly (<1000 h) energy storage than other energy storage technologies due to the low embodied energy cost of LOHC materials. Based on the analysis, the RHFC system with LOHC was concluded to be an attractive option for weekly and monthly energy storage of the both wind and solar power.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive review and critical analysis of the latest research results in addition to an overview of the future challenges and opportunities regarding the use of hydrogen to power internal combustion engines (ICEs). The experiences and opinions of various international research centers on the technical possibilities of using hydrogen as a fuel in ICE are summarized. The advantages and disadvantages of the use of hydrogen as a solution are described. Attention is drawn to the specific physical, chemical, and operational properties of hydrogen for ICEs. A critical review of hydrogen combustion concepts is provided, drawing on previous research results and experiences described in a number of research papers. Much space is devoted to discussing the challenges and opportunities associated with port and direct hydrogen injection technology. A comparison of different fuel injection and ignition strategies and the benefits of using the synergies of selected solutions are presented. Pointing to the previous experiences of various research centers, the hazards related to incorrect hydrogen combustion, such as early pre-ignition, late pre-ignition, knocking combustion, and backfire, are described. Attention is focused on the fundamental importance of air ratio optimization from the point of view of combustion quality, NOx emissions, engine efficiency, and performance. Exhaust gas scrubbing to meet future emission regulations for hydrogen powered internal combustion engines is another issue that is considered. The article also discusses the modifications required to adapt existing engines to run on hydrogen. Referring to still-unsolved problems, the reliability challenges faced by fuel injection systems, in particular, are presented. An analysis of more than 150 articles shows that hydrogen is a suitable alternative fuel for spark-ignition engines. It will significantly improve their performance and greatly reduce emissions to a fraction of their current level. However, its use also has some drawbacks, the most significant of which are its high NOx emissions and low power output, and problems in terms of the durability and reliability of hydrogen-fueled engines.},

	abstract = {The demand for fossil fuels is increasing because of globalization and rising energy demands. As a result, many nations are exploring alternative energy sources, and hydrogen is an efficient and practical alternative fuel. In the transportation industry, the development of hydrogen-powered cars aims to maximize fuel efficiency and significantly reduce exhaust gas emission and concentration. The impact of using hydrogen as a supplementary fuel for spark ignition (SI) and compression ignition (CI) engines on engine performance and gas emissions was investigated in this study. By adding hydrogen as a fuel in internal combustion engines, the torque, power, and brake thermal efficiency of the engines decrease, while their brake-specific fuel consumption increase. This study suggests that using hydrogen will reduce the emissions of CO, UHC, CO2, and soot; however, NOx emission is expected to increase. Due to the reduction of environmental pollutants for most engines and the related environmental benefits, hydrogen fuel is a clean and sustainable energy source, and its use should be expanded.},

Activated carbon composite support (ACCS) is modified to optimize its kinetic activity and its electrochemical stability shows excellent thermal stability and support stability under simulated start-up/shut-down operating conditions. The stabilities of various supports developed in this study are compared with those of a commercial Pt/C catalyst.

	abstract = {Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have been considered as promising candidates to tackle the need for sustainable and efficient energy conversion devices. However, the current operating temperature of SOFCs poses critical challenges relating to the costs of fabrication and materials selection. To overcome these issues, many attempts have been made by the SOFC research and manufacturing communities for lowering the operating temperature to intermediate ranges (600--800 $\,^{\circ}$C) and even lower temperatures (below 600 $\,^{\circ}$C). Despite the interesting success and technical advantages obtained with the low-temperature SOFC, on the other hand, the cell operation at low temperature could noticeably increase the electrolyte ohmic loss and the polarization losses of the electrode that cause a decrease in the overall cell performance and energy conversion efficiency. In addition, the electrolyte ionic conductivity exponentially decreases with a decrease in operating temperature based on the Arrhenius conduction equation for semiconductors. To address these challenges, a variety of materials and fabrication methods have been developed in the past few years which are the subject of this critical review. Therefore, this paper focuses on the recent advances in the development of new low-temperature SOFCs materials, especially low-temperature electrolytes and electrodes with improved electrochemical properties, as well as summarizing the matching current collectors and sealants for the low-temperature region. Different strategies for improving the cell efficiency, the impact of operating variables on the performance of SOFCs, and the available choice of stack designs, as well as the costing factors, operational limits, and performance prospects, have been briefly summarized in this work.},

	abstract = {Use of biomass for energy production is increasing, so management of the resultant ash is important. This review compares current and future production, chemical composition, and reuse options for ash from common feedstocks (agricultural residues, energy crops, woody biomass, forest residues, recovered wood, paper sludge, sewage sludge and municipal solid waste). Global production is ~170 Mt/yr, but could increase to ~1000 Mt/yr if all available biomass were exploited. Current production is dominated wood and waste derived ashes, but there is capacity to greatly increase use of agricultural residues. Combustion of virgin biomass in modern furnaces can produce ash with negligible persistent organic pollutants and low contaminant metals concentrations, so application to land is possible. Agricultural residue ashes contain abundant potassium and useful phosphate, so could potentially be used as fertiliser. Forestry ashes are rich in CaO, but slightly higher contaminant metals levels may restrict their use to forestry soils. Recovery of potassium from these ashes, and their use in cementitious materials have also been demonstrated. Biomass containing waste ashes potentially contain more persistent organic pollutants and contaminant metals. However, municipal solid waste bottom ash is routinely used as a construction aggregate for prescribed applications. Paper sludge ash is suitable for restricted use as a soil conditioner and possibly as a secondary pozzolan. However, controlled disposal may be required for recovered wood ash and sewage sludge incineration ash. As persistent organic pollutants tend to partition to the flue gases, fly ash and air-pollution control residues are likely to require controlled disposal.},

The novel biomass combustion system concept consisting of rotary burner and two types of combustion intensifiers is proposed, with the aim to allow simple application in the most of existing boilers, as well as to improve the efficiency and emissions to extent the related requirements of the relevant EU standards are met. In this regard, inclusion of the combustion intensifier based on honeycomb structure into conventional combustion system is numerically and experimentally investigated and the most appropriate placement in a furnace found. The results show that, with such implementation of the combustion intensifier, significant reductions in unburned pollutant emissions (CO >40% in case of wood pellets and >30% in case of agro pellets), particulate matter emissions (28--56 mg/mn3 at 10% of O2 in dry flue gases) and improvements in combustion efficiency (>2.6--3.7%) can be obtained. A detailed numerical analysis of the subsequent combustion process within the combustion intensifier lead to the novel combustion intensifier design, aimed at lowering manufacturing cost. Preliminary numerical and experimental results indicate similar or slightly less reduction in unburned pollutants of novel design.},

	abstract = {The article presents results from analyzing the state of the art achieved in the coal gasification technologies developed around the world and the demand for them. It is shown that such technologies have presently arrived at a crossroad in their development. Their future will be determined by the development prospects of coal energy as a whole. Coal still continues to play the most important role in the world energy. In recent years, external factors have become extremely negative for the development of coal energy. Among other fuels, coal produces the largest specific emissions of CO2 during its combustion, in view of which it may become the first victim of the unfolding energy decarbonization policy. Under such conditions, there is a need to diversify the coal utilization fields, primarily through manufacturing a wide range of chemical products with a high added value. This generates the need to develop the appropriate technologies, and, first of all, gasification technologies, the use of which opens the possibility of making almost the entire range of products from coal that are obtained from petroleum and natural gas. It has been determined that gasification technologies have already reached a high level of technical maturity, and a large number of gasifier designs have been proposed. It has been determined that the majority of operating coal gasification plants are presently used for manufacturing various chemical products, first of all, natural gas substitute (which is then forwarded to gas networks) and also methanol and ammonia. It is pointed out that only a few integrated gasification combined cycle plants have been implemented and planned for construction, which means that the private sector shows little interest in this technology. At the same time, such plants have quite a high potential for being used in low-carbon energy, of course, provided that the problem of disposing the captured CO2 is solved. It is shown that a large number of gasifier equipment manufacturers are available around the world. However, gasifiers are produced in single units or in a small series, which unavoidably leads to the high cost of this equipment. For the further innovative development of the gasification technology, combined efforts should be taken by the private sector and the state.},

	abstract = {Pressurized oxy-combustion is a promising technology for low-carbon, fossil fuel utilization. It has the potential of improved efficiency and economics compared with conventional atmospheric pressure oxy-combustion. Washington University in St. Louis has proposed a new pressurized oxy-combustion process, namely Staged Pressurized Oxy-Combustion, which has the potential to improve further the plant efficiency, operational flexibility, and economics. This process burns pulverized coal in a pressurized, oxy-combustion environment, which has not been demonstrated in a pilot-scale system before. To address this gap, a 100 kWth pressurized oxy-combustion facility was designed and constructed. This facility has a unique burner and furnace design featuring a co-axial, low-mixing flow field, which is drastically different from conventional coal-fired boiler designs where strong mixing is sought by introducing swirl or recirculating flows. This work aims to present the first pilot-scale experimental results of a dry-feed, pressurized oxy-combustion system. The tests focused on exploring flame stability and shape, char burnout, and fine particulate matter formation. Testing results suggest that the burner has excellent flame stability. The flame shape is consistent with the design philosophy and agrees with large eddy simulations. Importantly, complete char combustion can be achieved with an oxygen mole fraction in the flue gas of only 0.8%, as opposed to a required value of ~3% for conventional atmospheric pressure air-fired or oxyfuel combustion, which reduces the costs of both oxygen generation upstream and oxygen removal downstream. The testing results show promise for dry-feed, pressurized oxy-combustion, and the new burner and furnace design.},

Since the industrial revolution, the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have increased appreciably. This has been attributed to the utilization of fossil fuels for energy generation coupled with the clearing of forests and extensive manufacturing of some industrial products such as cement. The increase in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide has been widely linked to climate change and the Earth's temperature. A drastic approach is therefore needed in terms of policy formulation to address this global challenge. Carbon capture and storage are reliable tools that can be introduced to the industrial sector to address this issue. Therefore, this review presents a thorough investigation of the various technologies that can be harnessed to capture carbon dioxide. The cost associated with the capture, transport, and storage of the carbon dioxide is discussed. Socio-economic aspects of carbon capture and storage technologies are also presented in this review. Factors influencing public awareness of the technology and perceptions associated with carbon capture and storage should be a point for consideration in future research activities relating to this novel technology. This, in effect, this will ensure effective expert knowledge communication to the general public and foster social acceptance of this technology.},

Meanwhile, fossil fuel depletion has also been identified as a future challenge. This chapter reviews the connection between these two issues and concludes that limits to availability of fossil fuels will set a limit for mankind's ability to affect the climate. However, this limit is unclear as various studies have reached quite different conclusions regarding future atmospheric CO2 concentrations caused by fossil fuel limitations. It is concluded that the current set of emission scenarios used by the IPCC and others is perforated by optimistic expectations on future fossil fuel production that are improbable or even unrealistic. The current situation, where climate models largely rely on emission scenarios detached from the reality of supply and its inherent problems are problematic. In fact, it may even mislead planners and politicians into making decisions that mitigate one problem but make the other one worse. It is important to understand that the fossil energy problem and the anthropogenic climate change problem are tightly connected and need to be treated as two interwoven challenges necessitating a holistic solution.},

	abstract = {As fossil fuel power plants have emitted significant quantity of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere which aggravates climate change, capturing and storing such emissions is key to mitigate the issue. An adsorption system based on a physical adsorbent i.e. activated carbon is first assessed to capture CO2 emissions from a natural gas combined cycle. Then a subcritical sequential supplementary firing combined cycle with CO2 capture is used to analyse the effect of CO2 concentration. Analyses are carried out in terms of power loss and thermal efficiency. To evaluate the advantages of post-combustion CO2 capture using activated carbon, results are compared with systems using a commercial absorbent, i.e. monoethanolamine and a chemical adsorbent i.e. polyethyleneimine/silica. The net efficiency of natural gas combined cycle using activated carbon increases slightly from 50.8% to 51.1% due to the lower regeneration temperature at 358â€¯K. The performance of the system using PEI/silica is almost the same as that using activated carbon at 368â€¯K. Although the thermal energy required to regenerate the activated carbon is relatively high, a significant improvement of net efficiency is observed with increased partial pressure. Economic analysis indicates that the systems using activated carbon is a competitive alternative for CO2 capture. It is concluded activated carbon is relatively more advantageous than monoethanolamine in terms of efficiency and cost, which could be further improved with enhanced heat and mass recovery.},

	abstract = {Hybrid life cycle assessment has been used to assess the environmental impacts of natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) electricity generation with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). The CCS chain modeled in this study consists of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture from flue gas using monoethanolamine (MEA), pipeline transport and storage in a saline aquifer. Results show that the sequestration of 90% CO2 from the flue gas results in avoiding 70% of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere per kWh and reduces global warming potential (GWP) by 64%. Calculation of other environmental impacts shows the trade-offs: an increase of 43% in acidification, 35% in eutrophication, and 120--170% in various toxicity impacts. Given the assumptions employed in this analysis, emissions of MEA and formaldehyde during capture process and generation of reclaimer wastes contributes to various toxicity potentials and cause many-fold increase in the on-site direct freshwater ecotoxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity impacts. NOx from fuel combustion is still the dominant contributor to most direct impacts, other than toxicity potentials and GWP. It is found that the direct emission of MEA contribute little to human toxicity (HT<1%), however it makes 16% of terrestrial ecotoxicity impact. Hazardous reclaimer waste causes significant freshwater and marine ecotoxicity impacts. Most increases in impact are due to increased fuel requirements or increased investments and operating inputs. The reductions in GWP range from 58% to 68% for the worst-case to best-case CCS system. Acidification, eutrophication and toxicity potentials show an even large range of variation in the sensitivity analysis. Decreases in energy use and solvent degradation will significantly reduce the impact in all categories.},

	abstract = {Biomass as a renewable energy source is an alternative to fossil fuels. Due to its lower energy density compared to fossil fuels, different ways of converting biomass into an energy-dense fuel are sought after. Fast pyrolysis of biomass into pyrolysis oil represents such method, allowing wider substitution of fossil fuels. Pyrolysis is an energy-intensive process but its efficiency can be improved by integration of pyrolysis reactor into a combined heat and power plant. In this study environmental analyses are conducted on the production of 50â€¯000 tons of pyrolysis oil from wood to substitute for heavy fuel oil. The pyrolysis oil is produced either in a stand-alone reactor or as an integrated part of a combined heat and power plant. The combined heat and power plant is wood and peat fueled, producing of 820â€¯GWh of energy. The cradle-to-grave emissions of CO2-eq, NOx, SO2, and PM are calculated by using two methods: 1) life cycle assessment and 2) the Tool for Sustainability Impact Assessment. Reductions in environmental loads of over 75% in (fossil) CO2-eq and over 90% in NOx, SO2, and PM can be achieved when heavy fuel oil is replaced by pyrolysis oil. The pyrolysis is 20% more efficient if integrated with CHP production. The potential reductions vary several percent between the applied methods because of different system boundaries. Nevertheless, integrating the pyrolysis reactor into a combined heat and power plant appears as the best option irrespective of the method used. Extending the system boundaries with the life cycle inventories results in significant increases of emissions in many processes; however, combustion in plants has a dominant role in overall emissions but is not subject to the boundary extensions, and thus, the totals of emissions between the methods are nearly the same.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) is a promising countermeasure against global warming, but installing CCS into a power supply system causes a significant decrease in power output. Much research has already focused on the issue of how to facilitate implementation of CCS technology. This paper reviews recent studies on the efficiency penalty of coal-fired power plants with CCS. Efficiency penalty, which represents a net decrease in the power efficiency caused by the CO2 capture and compression process, can be estimated using process simulation that considers factors such as the power generation steam cycle, coal type, and CO2 capture and compression process. According to previous research, the efficiency penalty for current applications was about 10%. The ratio of efficiency penalty caused by CO2 capture to the total efficiency penalty was about two thirds. It appears that while the types of power plant and coal had little influence on efficiency penalty, the CO2 capture technology was critically important. By reducing the regeneration energy of the CO2 scrubbing solvent by 1 GJ/t-CO2, an approximate 2% efficiency improvement can be expected.},

We first develop a simple model incorporating agentsâ€² environmental awareness in their decision-making processes, which helps us to understand the fundamental mechanism. Using household level data taken from the 2015 China General Social Survey (CGSS), we then empirically test a number of hypotheses derived from the theoretical framework. Our results confirm that the role of awareness is important in affecting household energy consumption and pro-environmental choices. Both accessibility and affordability of using energy improves social wellbeing in terms of health status. Awareness alone does not necessarily reduce energy consumption, but subjective factors can play important roles. Moreover, householdâ€²s subjective attitude can significantly influence decisions to purchase more energy efficient products and encourage pro-environmental choices. Policy implications can be drawn from these results that government should play a more active role in raising public awareness of sustainable development.},

	abstract = {Development of renewable energy arguably depends on the choices of private consumers. The commitment to consume green energy means paying a higher price for energy compared the conventional energy sources, and motivating people to pay more for renewable energy is still a great challenge. The promotion of renewable energy is related to the three main positive aspects of green energy: outcomes on environment, outcomes on the country's development level and the social pressure. Focusing on these aspects, their impact on willingness to pay more for green energy in Lithuania was analyzed in this study. The regression analysis results showed that environmental concern negatively and insignificantly influenced willingness to pay more for green energy. Nevertheless, environmental concern affected willingness to pay indirectly, as an interaction of environmental concern and knowledge about green energy outcomes on environment. Pressure of subjective norms also significantly and positively determined the willingness to pay more. Meanwhile, knowledge about green energy outcomes on the country's level of development insignificantly motivated people to pay more for green energy. Out of socio-demographic factors, only age and income significantly influenced willingness to pay more for green energy, while gender insignificantly determined this intention. Therefore, this study provides new insights and possible policy implications in the context of country peculiarities, relevant to the whole Central Eastern Europe.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to predict the future situation of global energy development. In view of this, we reviewed the history of energy use and understood that new energy sources will usher in a new era following oil & gas, coal and wood one after another in the past time. Although the fossil energy sources are still plenty in the world, great breakthroughs made in some key technologies and the increasing demand for ecological environmental protection both impel the third time of transformation from oil & gas to new energy sources. Sooner or later, oil, gas, coal and new energy sources will each account for a quarter of global energy consumption in the new era, specifically speaking, accounting for 32.6%, 23.7%, 30.0% and 13.7% respectively. As one of the largest coal consumer, China will inevitably face up to the situation of tripartite confrontation of the coal, oil & gas and new energy. The following forecasting results were achieved. First, the oil will be in a stable period and its annual production peak will be around 2040, reaching up to 45 Ã— 108 t. Second, the natural gas will enter the heyday period and its annual production peak will be around 2060, reaching up to 4.5 Ã— 1012 m3, which will play a pivotal role in the future energy sustainable development. Third, the coal has entered a high-to-low-carbon transition period, and its direct use and the discharged pollutants will be significantly reduced. In 2050, the coal will be dropped to 25% of the primary energy mix. Last, the development and utilization of new energy sources has been getting into the golden age and its proportion in the primary energy mix will be substantially enhanced. On this basis, we presented some proposals for the future energy development in China. At first, we should understand well that China's energy production and consumption has its own characteristics. Under the present situation, we should strengthen the clean and efficient use of coal resources, which is the key to solving our energy and environmental issues. Then, under the low oil price circumstance, we should keep 200 million tons of annual oil production as ``the bottom line'' so as to ensure national energy security and to accelerate tight gas, shale gas and other unconventional resources development. In 2030, the annual natural gas production will reach up to more than 300 Bcm. Finally, the development and utilization of new energy resources should be further strengthened and non-fossil energy sources will be expected to reach as high as 20% of the primary energy consumption by 2030.},

Such materials occur for example in anodes of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) which consist of pores, nickel (Ni) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). The model is constructed using tools from stochastic geometry. More precisely, we model the backbones of the three phases by a certain class of random geometric graphs called beta-skeletons. This allows us to reproduce complete connectivity of all three phases as observed in experimental image data of a pristine Ni--YSZ anode as well as the prediction of volume fractions by model parameters. Finally a slightly generalized version of this model enables a good fit to experimental image data with respect to transport relevant microstructure characteristics and the length of triple phase boundary. Model validation is performed by comparing effective transport properties from finite element (FE) simulations based on 3D-data from the stochastic model and from tomography of real Ni--YSZ anodes. Moreover, the virtual, but realistic Ni--YSZ microstructures can be used for investigating the quantitative influence of microstructure characteristics on various physical properties and consequently on the performance of the anode material.},

	abstract = {Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) systems with internal steam reforming have the potential to become an economically competitive technology for cogeneration power plants, exploiting its significantly higher electrical efficiency compared to existing technologies. Optimal design and operation of such a system require SOFC models that include accurate description of the steam reforming rate. The objective of this article is to review the reported kinetic expressions for the steam reforming reaction. Extensive work has been performed on traditional catalysts for steam reforming. Because of differences in operating conditions, catalyst support material and structure it is critical to transfer this knowledge directly to internal reforming in SOFCs, which is discussed in further detail in this article. There are big differences in the reported kinetic expression for steam reforming over both industrial Ni catalysts and SOFC anode materials. Surprisingly, there is a good agreement between measured rates pr. geometric anode area at high operating temperatures, even for very different anodes. Detailed experimental data on the intrinsic steam reforming kinetics of Ni-YSZ are necessary for micro structure SOFC modeling, such expression are however lacking, but it may be viable to use measurements on industrial steam reforming catalysts instead. Nevertheless there is a further need for experimental studies on determining the exact steam reforming kinetics for SOFC anodes.},

@article{Wei2004,
	abstract = {Kinetic and isotopic tracer methods led to a simple and unifying mechanistic proposal for reactions of CH4 with CO2 and H2O, for its decomposition on Rh clusters, and for water--gas shift reactions. Kinetic rates for forward reactions were measured by correcting net rates for approach to equilibrium and by eliminating transport artifacts. These rates were proportional to CH4 pressure (5--450 kPa) and independent of CO2 or H2O pressures (5--450 kPa) on all supported Rh catalysts; the resulting first-order rate constants were identical for H2O and CO2 reforming and for CH4 decomposition. Kinetic isotope effects (kCH4/kCD4=1.54--1.60) were also independent of the concentration or identity of the co-reactant, consistent with the sole kinetic relevance of Cî—¸H bond activation steps. These data indicate that co-reactant activation and its kinetic coupling with CH4 activation via scavenging of chemisorbed carbon intermediates are fast steps and lead to Rh surfaces essentially uncovered by reactive intermediates during H2O and CO2 reforming. CO oxidation rates before and after reforming reactions showed that Rh surfaces remain uncovered by unreactive species during reforming catalysis under conditions relevant to industrial practice. CH4 conversion rates for CH4/CD4/CO2 reactant mixtures are much faster than CH4âˆ’xDx formation rates, indicating that Cî—¸H bond activation elementary steps are irreversible. CH4/CO2/D2 reactant mixtures led to binomial isotopomer distributions in dihydrogen and water at all reactant conversions. Their D contents were identical and corresponded to equilibration between all H atoms in reacted CH4 and all D2 in the inlet stream. Thus, recombinative desorption steps of H atoms and OH groups to form H2 or H2O are quasi-equilibrated during CH4 reforming. 12CH4/12CO2/13CO mixtures led to identical 13C contents in CO and CO2, as expected from quasi-equilibrated CO2 activation steps. The quasi-equilibrated nature of all these steps requires that water--gas shift reactions also be at equilibrium during CH4 reforming, as found experimentally. CH4 reforming turnover rates increased as the size of Rh clusters supported on Al2O3 or ZrO2 decreased, suggesting that coordinatively unsaturated Rh surface atoms prevalent in smaller clusters activate Cî—¸H bonds more effectively than atoms on lower-index surfaces, as also found on single-crystal surfaces. Turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support; any involvement of the support in the activation of co-reactants is not kinetically relevant.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the possible use of methane, methanol, and ethanol with steam as a direct feed to Ni/YSZ anode of a direct internal reforming Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (DIR-SOFC). It was found that methane with appropriate steam content can be directly fed to Ni/YSZ anode without the problem of carbon formation, while methanol can also be introduced at a temperature as high as 1000$\,^{\circ}$C. In contrast, ethanol cannot be used as the direct fuel for DIR-SOFC operation even at high steam content and high operating temperature due to the easy degradation of Ni/YSZ by carbon deposition. From the steam reforming of ethanol over Ni/YSZ, significant amounts of ethane and ethylene were present in the product gas due to the incomplete reforming of ethanol. These formations are the major reason for the high rate of carbon formation as these components act as very strong promoters for carbon formation. It was further observed that ethanol with steam can be used for an indirect internal reforming operation (IIR-SOFC) instead. When ethanol was first reformed by Ni/Ce--ZrO2 at the temperature above 850$\,^{\circ}$C, the product gas can be fed to Ni/YSZ without the problem of carbon formation. Finally, it was also proposed from the present work that methanol with steam can be efficiently fed to Ni/YSZ anode (as DIR operation) at the temperature between 900 and 975$\,^{\circ}$C without the problem of carbon formation when SOFC system has sufficient space volume at the entrance of the anode chamber, where methanol can homogeneously convert to CH4, CO, CO2, and H2 before reaching SOFC anode.},

	abstract = {With the availability of more and more efficient and sophisticated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools, engineering designs are also becoming more and more software driven. Yet, the insights in temporal and spatial scaling issues are still with us and very often imbedded in complexity and many design aspects. In this paper, with a revisit to a so-called leakage issue in sucker rod pumps prevalent in petroleum industries, the author would like to demonstrate the need to use perturbation approaches to circumvent the multi-scale challenges in CFD with extreme spatial aspect ratios and temporal scales. In this study, the gap size between the outer surface of the plunger and the inner surface of the barrel is measured with a mill (one thousandth of an inch) whereas the plunger axial length is measured with inches or even feet. The temporal scales, namely relaxation times, are estimated with both expansions in Bessel functions for the annulus flow region and expansions in Fourier series when such a narrow circular flow region is approximated with a rectangular one. These engineering insights derived from the perturbation approaches have been confirmed with the use of full-fledged CFD analyses with sophisticated computational tools as well as experimental measurements. With these confirmations, new perturbation studies on the sucker rod leakage issue with eccentricities have been presented. The volume flow rate or rather leakage due to the pressure difference is calculated as a quadratic function with respect to the eccentricity, which matches with the early prediction and publication with comprehensive CFD studies. In short, a healthy combination of ever more powerful modeling tools along with the physics, mathematics, and engineering insights with dimensionless numbers and classical perturbation approaches may provide a balanced and more flexible and efficient strategy in complex engineering designs with the consideration of parametric and phase spaces.},

	abstract = {{Experiments on oil displacement from homogeneous porous media have shown that the component porous media have shown that the component oil flow across the layer is often negligibly small compared with that parallel to it. This result is applied in the inspectional analysis of the equations governing the macroscopic displacement processes. It is shown that in rectangular homogeneous models the dimensionless groups l/h and a can usually be neglected. This finding has been proved experimentally in rectangular models of various dimensions, two extremes of which are described in this paper.The work has been extended to curved models. An additional requirement is that the angles of dip must be small. Comparative experiments have been carried out in three-dimensional models of various geometrical configurations. The results of both studies indicate a greater flexibility in the use of models than has previously been assumed.The production behavior of petroleum reservoirs can to a large extent be investigated with the help of scaled models, although the great number of parameters to be scaled in such processes precludes parameters to be scaled in such processes precludes complete simulation. However, not all parameters have an equally important influence on the process; and it is therefore necessary to select the most important ones and investigate which parameters can possibly be neglected.To date, oil reservoirs have almost always been represented by models of similar geometry. In other words, the characteristic length, width and height are scaled down by the same factor. For many reservoirs, however, the length-height ratio is extremely large, and laboratory models become inconveniently long or very thin. In such cases it would be desirable to make the model too thick relatively. It will be demonstrated that this is in a number of cases a justifiable solution.}},

Among various alternatives, biogas reforming is an attractive choice for hydrogen production. To meet the authorities' requirements, reforming biogas-enriched natural gas and sole biogas is tempting. Highly effective process conditions of biogas reforming are yet to be designed. The current state of the art lacks proper optimization of the process conditions. The optimization should aim to allow for maximization of the process effectiveness and limitation of the phenomena having an adverse influence on the process itself. One of the issues that should be addressed in optimization is the uniformity of temperature inside a reactor. Here we show an optimization design study that aims to unify temperature distribution by novel arrangements of catalysts segments in the model biogas reforming reactor. The acquired numerical results confirm the possibility of the enhancement of reaction effectiveness, coming from improving the thermal conditions. The used amount of catalytic material is remarkably reduced as a side effect of the presented optimization. To ensure an unhindered perception of the reaction improvement, the authors proposed a ratio of the hydrogen output and the amount of used catalyst as a measure.},

The reverse water-gas shift reaction was found to be close to thermodynamic equilibrium over all catalysts. Partial pressure dependencies were obtained with the Ni/C and Ni/SiO2 catalysts at 723 K for comparative purposes only, but a more thorough kinetic analysis was made with the Ni/MgO and Ni/TiO2 catalysts, which were shown previously to strongly inhibit carbon deposition. Partial pressure dependencies were obtained at 673, 698, and 723 K for Ni/TiO2 and at 773, 798, and 823 K for Ni/MgO. In situ DRIFTS studies clearly showed the presence of both linear and bridged carbon monoxide adsorption on Ni/SiO2 under reaction conditions; however, adsorbed carbon monoxide could not be identified on Ni/TiO2. A reaction model for CH4---CO2 reforming, based on CH4 activation to form CHx and CHxO decomposition as the slow kinetic steps, successfully correlated the rate data.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm called probabilistic global search lausanne (PGSL). PGSL is founded on the assumption that optimal solutions can be identified through focusing search around sets of good solutions. Tests on benchmark problems having multi-parameter non-linear objective functions revealed that PGSL performs better than genetic algorithms and advanced algorithms for simulated annealing in 19 out of 23 cases studied. Furthermore as problem sizes increase, PGSL performs increasingly better than these other approaches. Empirical evidence of the convergence of PGSL is provided through its application to Lennard--Jones cluster optimisation problem. Finally, PGSL has already proved to be valuable for engineering tasks in areas of design, diagnosis and control.},

	abstract = {The multiscale finite-volume (MSFV) method for the solution of elliptic problems is extended to an efficient iterative algorithm that converges to the fine-scale numerical solution. The localization errors in the MSFV method are systematically reduced by updating the local boundary conditions with global information. This iterative multiscale finite-volume (i-MSFV) method allows the conservative reconstruction of the velocity field after any iteration, and the MSFV method is recovered, if the velocity field is reconstructed after the first iteration. Both the i-MSFV and the MSFV methods lead to substantial computational savings, where an approximate but locally conservative solution of an elliptic problem is required. In contrast to the MSFV method, the i-MSFV method allows a systematic reduction of the error in the multiscale approximation. Line relaxation in each direction is used as an efficient smoother at each iteration. This smoother is essential to obtain convergence in complex, highly anisotropic, heterogeneous domains. Numerical convergence of the method is verified for different test cases ranging from a standard Poisson equation to highly heterogeneous, anisotropic elliptic problems. Finally, to demonstrate the efficiency of the method for multiphase transport in porous media, it is shown that it is sufficient to apply the iterative smoothing procedure for the improvement of the localization assumptions only infrequently, i.e. not every time step. This result is crucial, since it shows that the overall efficiency of the i-MSFV algorithm is comparable with the original MSFV method. At the same time, the solutions are significantly improved, especially for very challenging cases.},

Steam reforming of n-hexadecane on a rhodium/nickel catalyst supported on Î³-alumina, a formulation previously proposed for steam reforming of logistic fuel, was used to study the deactivation mechanisms. The steam reforming activity was measured in terms of H2 yields and showed that the catalysts were stable in the absence of sulfur but deactivated over a period of 10h when sulfur was present at high loading. Stability and activity were higher with higher amounts of Rh content when Ni was kept constant. TEM-EDS of used catalysts revealed preferential adsorption of sulfur on the surface of Ni crystallites; EDS and XRD analysis showed no bulk sulfide formation. Excessive carbon deposition was observed during steam reforming of sulfur-containing fuel. Blocking of reactant species on the surface of the catalyst due to the formation of aromatic/polymeric carbon on the support was also seen, although higher Rh content inhibited this phenomenon.},

High-order accuracy in time is obtained by marching the solution with Runge--Kutta methods. The incompressibility constraint is enforced for each Runge--Kutta stage iteratively either by local pressure correction or by a Poisson-equation based global pressure correction method. Local pressure correction is carried out on cell by cell basis using a local, fourth-order accurate discrete analog of the continuity equation. The global pressure correction is based on the numerical solution of a Poisson-type equation which is discretized to fourth-order accuracy, and solved using GMRES. In both cases, the updated pressure is used to recompute the velocities in order to satisfy the incompressibility constraint to fourth-order accuracy. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated in test problems.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a transient microstructure-oriented numerical simulation of a planar Direct Internal Reforming Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (DIR-SOFC) is delivered. The performance criteria in a direct steam reforming for a fuel starvation scenario are analyzed in order to optimize the underlying process. The proposed two-dimensional multiscale model takes into account mass and heat transport, electrochemistry, as well as the intrinsic steam-reforming kinetics. In the paper, the methane/steam reforming process over the Ni/YSZ catalyst is experimentally investigated to verify the used chemical reaction model. A three-dimensional digital microstructure representation of the commercial anode is analyzed using a Focused Ion Beam-Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM) and the nickel-pore contact surface is calculated to relate the reforming reaction rate to the catalyst's active area. Based on the complete DIR-SOFC model, a parametric study is carried out, to simulate the dynamic response of a fuel cell for different design and operating conditions. The results prove the dominant impact of inlet fluid temperature and methane content on the calculated distribution of hydrogen across the channel, while the collected current density was found to be a less important factor. The simulations indicate, that in the case of the direct reforming, fuel starvation is likely to occur in the upstream of the anode channel, where the reforming reaction does not keep up with producing hydrogen. The obtained results provide a significant insight into safe and efficient control strategies for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells.},

@article{Pajak2021IJHEb,
	abstract = {The steam reforming reaction is widely used for obtaining hydrogen. The reforming reaction has a strong endothermic character, which means it requires a considerable and continuous heat supply to proceed. Due to the process character, a highly non-uniform temperature field develops inside the reactor. It has a consequence in large temperature gradients, leading to the catalyst degradation and a reduced lifetime of the reforming unit. The aim of the presented research is to unify the temperature field developing in the reactor, for easier control of the process and extension of the reformer's life expectancy. A conventional plug-flow reactor consists of a cylindrical pipe body filled with catalyst. The presented methodology included optimizing the catalyst distribution in the reactor to acquire the most uniform temperature field possible. A genetic algorithm is selected as an optimization technique for finding the most advantageous alignment of the catalyst. It is an example of evolutionary algorithms, basing on rules similar to natural selection. The algorithm generates a random, initial population of reactors and the reforming simulation is executed for each of them. The computation results are then evaluated and ranked using predefined fitness functions. The ranked reactors parameters' are further recombined with selection probability based on the fitness values, until a whole new population is created and the algorithm's loop restarts. The higher the fitness value of a specific reactor, the higher are the chances of passing its segments composition to the proceeding generation. The fitness computation leaves a vast space for improvements, as it may be computed based on many different process' parameters. This work focuses on distinguishing differences in the algorithm performance, depending on the formula for fitness calculation. The algorithm's converging speed, overall fitness values of specimens and optimization results were investigated and compared. The results show that the algorithm with an updated fitness calculation procedure performs considerably better. Only about 50% of computational time was required, to acquire results of the same quality for the presented numerical cases, when comparing with the previously prepared procedure.},

	abstract = {The presented research focuses on an optimization design of a catalyst distribution inside a small-scale methane/steam reforming reactor. A genetic algorithm was used for the multiobjective optimization, which included the search for an optimum of methane conversion rate and a minimum of the difference between highest and lowest temperatures in the reactor. For the sake of computational time, the maximal number of the segment with different catalyst densities was set to be thirty in this study. During the entire optimization process, every part of the reactor could be filled, either with a catalyst material or non-catalytic metallic foam. In both cases, the porosity and pore size was also specified. The impact of the porosity and pore size on the active reaction surface and permeability was incorporated using graph theory and three-dimensional digital material representation. Calculations start with the generation of a random set of possible reactors, each with a different catalyst distribution. The algorithm calls reforming simulation over each of the reactors, and after obtaining concentration and temperature fields, the algorithms calculated fitness function.

@article{Mazhar2021,
	abstract = {Co/TiO2--MgAl2O4 was investigated in a fixed bed reactor for the dry reforming of methane (DRM) process. Co/TiO2--MgAl2O4 was prepared by modified co-precipitation, followed by the hydrothermal method. The active metal Co was loaded via the wetness impregnation method. The prepared catalyst was characterized by XRD, SEM, TGA, and FTIR. The performance of Co/TiO2--MgAl2O4 for the DRM process was investigated in a reactor with a temperature of 750 $\,^{\circ}$C, a feed ratio (CO2/CH4) of 1, a catalyst loading of 0.5 g, and a feed flow rate of 20 mL minâˆ’1. The effect of support interaction with metal and the composite were studied for catalytic activity, the composite showing significantly improved results. Moreover, among the tested Co loadings, 5 wt% Co over the TiO2--MgAl2O4 composite shows the best catalytic performance. The 5%Co/TiO2--MgAl2O4 improved the CH4 and CO2 conversion by up to 70% and 80%, respectively, while the selectivity of H2 and CO improved to 43% and 46.5%, respectively. The achieved H2/CO ratio of 0.9 was due to the excess amount of CO produced because of the higher conversion rate of CO2 and the surface carbon reaction with oxygen species. Furthermore, in a time on stream (TOS) test, the catalyst exhibited 75 h of stability with significant catalytic activity. Catalyst potential lies in catalyst stability and performance results, thus encouraging the further investigation and use of the catalyst for the long-run DRM process.},

	abstract = {This review will explore the influences of the active metal, support, promoter, preparation methods, calcination temperature, reducing environment, particle size and reactor choice on catalytic activity and carbon deposition for the dry reforming of methane. Bimetallic (Niâˆ’Pt, Niâˆ’Rh, Niâˆ’Ce, Niâˆ’Mo, Niâˆ’Co) and monometallic (Ni) catalysts are preferred for dry reforming compared to noble metals (Rh, Ru and Pt) due to their low-cost. Investigation of support materials indicated that ceriaâˆ’zirconia mixtures, ZrO2 with alkali metals (Mg2+, Ca2+, Y2+) addition, MgO, SBA-15, ZSM-5, CeO2, BaTiO3 and Ca0.8Sr0.2TiO3 showed improved catalytic activities and decreased carbon deposition. The modifying effects of cerium (Ce), magnesium (Mg) and yttrium (Y) were significant for dry reforming of methane. MgO, CeO2 and La2O3 promoters for metal catalysts supported on mesoporous materials had the highest catalyst stability among all the other promoters. Preparation methods played an important role in the synthesis of smaller particle size and higher dispersion of active metals. Calcination temperature and treatment duration imparted significant changes to the morphology of catalysts as evident by XRD, TPR and XPS. Catalyst reduction in different environments (H2, He, H2/He, O2/He, H2âˆ’N2 and CH4/O2) indicated that probably the mixture of reducing agents will lead to enhanced catalytic activities. Smaller particle size (<15nm) had a significant influence on the suppression of carbon deposition and catalytic activity. Fluidized bed reactor exhibited the highest activity and stability, lower carbon deposition and higher conversion compared to a fixed-bed reactor. Moreover, membrane reactor, solar reactor, high-pressure reactor and microreactor were also investigated with specific features such as: pure H2 production, detailed reaction information with enhanced safety, higher pressure applications and dry reforming reaction with/without catalyst under sunlight. The study of parameters would improve the understanding of various preparation and reaction conditions leading to various catalytic activities.},

	abstract = {Biogas, landfill gas, associated petroleum gas, and other tail gases accompanying various industrial processes are potential sources of hydrogen and carbon monoxide for solid oxide fuel cells via the reforming process. As these gases contain heavy hydrocarbons, fine-tuning of steam and carbon dioxide addition and specific temperature control are necessary to avoid carbon deposition during the reforming process. Numerical simulation plays a crucial role in designing miniaturized steam reforming reactors and optimal working conditions. All simulations of reforming processes must account for carbon deposition. The methods commonly seen in the open literature include Gibbs free energy minimization or parametric equations formalism. This paper utilizes Gaussian process regression as a tool for making predictions about which reforming parameters are suitable for carrying out this process without the danger of damaging the catalyst due to a carbon formation. Parametric equations formalism and Gibbs free energy minimization involve either the minimization of objective function or a search for roots of nonlinear functions. These tasks are sensitive to a choice of the starting points of the algorithm --- wrong choice of starting points could lead to numerical instability. Unlike conventional methods, the Gaussian process regression approach bypasses the computation of equilibrium composition. It predicts carbon formation tendencies directly from the initial conditions which ensure stability.},

In this work, the mathematical model of afterburner-powered methane/steam reformer is proposed. To analyze the effect of a fuel composition on SOFC performance, the zero-dimensional model of a fuel cell connected with a reformer is formulated.

These include: steam-methane reforming (SMR), partial oxidation (POX) and autothermal reforming (ATR). Thereby, favourable operating conditions are identified for each process. The optimum steam-to-carbon (S:C) ratio of the SMR reactor is found to be 1.9. The optimum air ratio of the POX reactor is 0.3 at a preheat temperature of 312$\,^{\circ}$C. The optimum air ratio and S:C ratio of the ATR reactor are 0.29 and 0.35, respectively at a preheat temperature of 400$\,^{\circ}$C. Simulated material and energy balances show that the CH4 flow rates required to generate 1molsâˆ’1 of hydrogen are 0.364molsâˆ’1 for POX, 0.367molsâˆ’1 for ATR and 0.385molsâˆ’1 for the SMR. These results demonstrate that the POX reforming system has the lowest energy cost to produce the same amount of hydrogen from CH4.},

	abstract = {Fe-modified Ni-based catalysts are synthesized using a microwave-assisted synthesis method and are used for CO2 reforming of methane (CRM) with a small amount of oxygen to produce syngas. The effect of Fe loading, impregnation temperature, and microwave power on the structural feature and catalytic performance of prepared catalysts is examined. The results show that the addition of slight oxygen increases CH4 conversion and decreases coke deposit. The Fe loading has a remarkable influence on the structure and catalytic performance of the catalysts. The introduction of Fe into the Ni-based catalyst improves the specific surface area and decreases the Ni particle size, which promotes the formation of the Fe--Ni alloy, resulting in the enhancement of catalytic activity, stability, and H2/CO ratio compared with an unmodified catalyst. However, higher Fe loading decreases the catalytic performance. The impregnation temperature and microwave power influence the catalytic activities remarkably. When Fe loading is 1 wt%, the impregnation temperature and microwave power are 60 $\,^{\circ}$C and 600 W, respectively, the resultant catalyst shows the highest catalytic activity and maintains its activity for 80 h during CRM reaction.

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to provide a state-of-the-art review for the structural application, manufacturing, material properties, and modeling of a new material: steel foam. Foamed steel includes air voids in the material microstructure and as a result introduces density as a new design variable in steel material selection. By controlling density the engineering properties of steel components may be altered significantly: improvement in the weight-to-stiffness ratio is particularly pronounced, as is the available energy dissipation and thermal resistivity. Full-scale applications of steel foams in civil structures have not yet been demonstrated. Therefore, existing applications demonstrating either proof-of-concept for steel foam, or full-scale use of aluminum foams in situations with clear civil/structural analogs are highlighted. Adoption of steel foam relies on the manufacturing method, particularly its cost, and the resulting properties of the steel foam. Therefore, published methods for producing steel foam are summarized, along with measurements of steel foam structural (modulus, yield stress, etc.) and non-structural (thermal conductivity, acoustic absorption, etc.) properties. Finally, existing models for predicting foamed steel material properties are summarized to highlight the central role of material density. Taken in total the existing research demonstrates the viability of steel foams for use in civil/structural applications, while also pointing to areas where further research work is required. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {This paper presents a detailed analysis of the steam reforming process from first-principles calculations, supported by insight from experimental investigations. In the present work we employ recently recognised scaling relationships for adsorption energies of simple molecules adsorbed at pure metal surfaces to develop an overview of the steam reforming process catalyzed by a range of transition metal surfaces. By combining scaling relationships with thermodynamic and kinetic analysis, we show that it is possible to determine the reactivity trends of the pure metals for methane steam reforming. The reaction is found to be kinetically controlled by a methane dissociation step and a CO formation step, where the latter step is found to be dominant at lower temperatures. The particle size of the metal catalysts particles have been determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the turn over frequency observed to be linearly dependent on the dispersion, supporting the theoretical notion that the active sites are most likely present as one dimensional edges. It has been found that determination of the correct particle size distribution of small (2--4 nm) Ru particles requires in situ TEM measurements under a hydrogen atmosphere. The overall agreement between theory and experiment (at 773 K, 1 bar pressure and 10% conversion) is found to be excellent with Ru and Rh being the most active pure transition metals for methane steam reforming, while Ni, Ir, Pt, and Pd are significantly less active at similar dispersion.},

	abstract = {This paper reports experimental and modeling investigations of thermal methane reforming chemistry within porous Ni--YSZ anode materials. Because the reforming chemistry is difficult to observe directly in an operating fuel cell, a specially designed experiment is developed. In the experiment a 0.75â€‰mm-thick anode is sandwiched between two small co-flowing gas channels. One channel represents the fuel channel of a solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The composition in the other channel carries the species that would be produced in an operating fuel cell by the electrochemical charge-transfer reactions in the thin three-phase regions near the interface between the anode and the dense electrolyte membrane (i.e., H2O and CO2). Because the anode structure is porous (and there is no dense electrolyte or cathode applied), there is convective and diffusive species flux between the two flow channels. The entire assembly is maintained at approximately 800â€‰$\,^{\circ}$C in a furnace. The results of heterogeneous reforming kinetics are determined by using mass spectrometry to measure the species composition at the outlet of both channels. Experimental results are interpreted using a computational model that incorporates channel gas flow, porous-media transport, and elementary heterogeneous chemical kinetics. The overall objective is to develop quantitative models of non-electrochemical heterogeneous reforming chemistry within a Ni--YSZ anode.},

With the above kinetics, simulation study has been carried out to find out temperature distribution in the micro-channel over coating catalyst at two different types of boundary conditions. The results show a quite different ``cold spot'' character and reactants, products distribution character in the reaction channel due to its own distinct heat and mass transfer features. The kinetics and simulation study results can be applied in aid of micro-channel reactor design, and suggestion has been proposed for catalytic coating preparation and optimization.},

	abstract = {The reforming of pure ethanol was studied over a bi-metallic precious metal (Rh/Pt) catalyst deposited on a ceramic monolith in order to analyze reforming process conditions. High ethanol conversion tests performed at low space velocities (<20,000hâˆ’1) confirmed that the catalyst could achieve 100% ethanol conversion to equilibrium concentrations of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4. Low conversion tests at high space velocities (â‰¥50,000hâˆ’1) were conducted to produce an overall rate expression with an activation energy of 85kJmoleâˆ’1. The reaction was found to have a 1.2 reaction order for ethanol and zero order for water for stoichiometric ethanol and water ratios. In addition, the impact of non-catalytic reactions was studied. The results showed that the catalyst was capable of reforming ethanol as well as the by-products from non-catalytic reactions at 500--700$\,^{\circ}$C. This work is part 1 of a series to develop a process for steam reforming E85 (85% ethanol+15% gasoline) to generate hydrogen for a fuel cell.},

Top wall of the heat exchanging device is designed as a sinusoidal corrugated/wavy wall. Three different wavelengths (Lw) of 39, 24.375 and 17.728 mm and three different wave amplitudes (a) of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mm along with various heights of metallic foam of 0.25H, 0.5H and 0.75H are considered. Two different pore density of 20 and 40 with constant porosity of 0.937 are accomplished for the numerical investigation over wide range of fluid velocities. Local thermal equilibrium (LTE) and Darcy extended Forchheimer (DEF) models are employed at the metallic foam region; k-Îµ turbulence model is accomplished at free flow region of the channel. The heat dissipation rate at the cold wall increases significantly to a maximum height of 0.5H and increases with increasing wave amplitudes of the channel at the expense of pressure drop. On account of smaller wavelength and higher wave amplitude, the heat absorption rate is found to be 26.25% - 32% more than the straight channel with 25% filling rate of metallic foams in the range of fluid velocity considered.},

According to the carried simulations, it is found that these configurations improve the reformer performances compared to the continuous catalyst layer configuration. The insertion of metal foam increases the efficiency of up to 75.41% at 525 K. Also, at this reaction temperature, the segmentation of the catalyst layer in similar parts increases the reformer efficiency by 2.11%, 4.23%, 6.77%, and 8.6% for 2, 4, 8, and 16 identical parts, respectively. As well as, the metal foam as catalyst support is more efficient compared to the other configurations, the efficiency is equal to 64% at T = 495 k.},

These experiments performed with water were scaled to estimate the heat exchangers' performance when used with a 50% water--ethylene glycol solution, and were then compared to the performance of commercially available heat exchangers which were designed for the same heat transfer application. The heat exchangers were compared on the basis of required pumping power versus thermal resistance. The compressed open-cell aluminum foam heat exchangers generated thermal resistances that were two to three times lower than the best commercially available heat exchanger tested, while requiring the same pumping power.},

In the conducted research an anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with Nickel/Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (Ni/YSZ) anode, Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, and Lanthanum Strontium Cobalt Ferrite oxide (LSCF) cathode was tested. Current densities under concentration polarization were measured for different hydrogen partial pressure on the anodic side. Mass transport through a porous anode was analyzed for the H2-N2-H2O ternary system. Cell performances were measured at 700 [$\,^{\circ}$C] and 800 [$\,^{\circ}$C] with air as an oxidant. Obtained saturation current densities were used for the tortuosity calculations. The presented calculation methodology was based on the Stefan-Maxwell equation and Kundsen diffusion. After the power generation experiment, a three dimensional structure was reconstructed using a combination of scanning electron microscope and focus ion beam milling (FIB-SEM). Finally, tortuosity values derived from the transport limitation and structure analysis were juxtaposed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The use of thermal power plants has been increasing lately, despite its use being associated with high greenhouse gases emissions, especially carbon dioxide. In the context of the Paris Agreement of 2015, carbon dioxide capture, storage and utilization techniques must be increasingly employed to reduce environmental impacts. The utilization of carbon dioxide from a power plant flue gas as feedstock to other chemicals synthesis (such as ammonia and urea) arises as a good alternative to achieve near-zero carbon dioxide emissions. The aim of this work is to propose an alternative route, based on the bi-reforming of methane, for the synthesis gas section of ammonia and urea production plants, in order to promote carbon dioxide abatement, comparing this innovative route with the conventional and century-long existing process. Technical and environmental metrics of the proposed and conventional routes were compared. Aspen Plus{\textregistered} process simulator was used to simulate the bi-reforming process and both routes for ammonia and urea synthesis and choose the operational parameters. Simulation results show that for a target production of 2000 tonne/day of urea, the proposed alternative route has the potential to abate 745 tonne/day of carbon dioxide, while the conventional route emits 1156 tonne/day of carbon dioxide. Comparison of technical metrics of both routes shows that the proposed route requires an electricity usage of 0.27 MWh/tonne of products while the conventional route requires 0.47 MWh/tonne of products. However, hydrogen yield in the conventional route is higher than in its counterpart, with 0.41 and 0.22 tonnes of hydrogen produced for each tonne of inlet natural gas in the conventional and proposed routes, respectively. Comparison of economic metrics of both configurations show that none of the routes are economically viable, however, the alternative route has better economic indicators besides successfully promotes carbon dioxide abatement.},

Based on the kinetic models of methane steam reforming developed by Xu and Froment, the effective kinetic models were developed. Combining the experiment data with the iteration calculation, the effective factor (Ce) is found to be 5.0Ã—10âˆ’4. Using these effective kinetic models, the detailed distributions of temperature, species, methane conversion, and carbon formation and gasification activity are presented under wide range of operating conditions. The results show that the local temperature in the reactor and the methane conversion are sensitive to the operating parameters. The region of the lowest local temperature and the most possible region of carbon formation are at the front of the porous anode sample. Due to the limitation of contact time, heat transfer and species diffusion, the methane conversion appreciably decreases with an increase of S/C ratio.},
